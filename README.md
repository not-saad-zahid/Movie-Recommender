# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to recommend movies in a personalized and efficient way.

The goal is to enhance user experience by helping them discover new films that match their tastes using machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

- 🔧 **Scalable Design**: Easy to adapt for larger datasets or integration into streaming platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Source**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
